Solves a given Transportation Problem in Operations Research step-by-step!  
Designed for teaching/demonstration purposes.

![The GUI for the program.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RussellAndrewEdson/TransportationTableaux/master/transportationtableaux_v3screenshot.png "Solving a transportation problem with the GUI")

The program has finally been released!

At this point, the program is completely functional.
A tutorial on how to use the program to solve a Transportation problem can be found in the User Guide.

For ease of use, an executable .jar file has been assembled that can be run in any Java Runtime Environment.
(All the Scala core libraries are bundled in as well -- convenient, though it does make the file quite hefty at ~8MB.)

Those that would like to play around with the source code are encouraged to use the Scala Build Tool (http://www.scala-sbt.org/), which easily retrieves all of the necessary Scala libraries and allows for the interfaces and tests to be run straight from the command line.
