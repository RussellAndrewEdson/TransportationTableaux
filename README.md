TransportationTableaux
======================

Solves a given Transportation Problem in Operations Research step-by-step! Designed for teaching/demonstration purposes.

The console version of this program is functional (as of 23/08/2014). After prompting for the supplies, demands and link-flow costs for the Transportation problem, the program will then print a series of detailed tableaux, including the basic solution at each point, the cost, and (if the tableau is not yet optimal), the "star pair" and the cycle that the allocations are adjusted along.

The next stage of this project is the construction of a more user-friendly GUI, completely packaged into an executable .jar (as well as more testing of the TransportationTableau class). But in the interim, all of the useful solution information is available in the console version.
