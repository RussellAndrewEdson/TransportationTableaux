TransportationTableaux
======================

Solves a given Transportation Problem in Operations Research step-by-step!  
Designed for teaching/demonstration purposes.

![The GUI for the program.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RussellAndrewEdson/TransportationTableaux/master/gui_screenshot.png "Solving a transportation problem with the GUI")

The hardest part of the GUI (the grid and cycle) have been completed as of 25/09/2014. All that is left to do is refactor some of the classes and finish all documentation (including hopefully a brief tutorial-style user guide) and modify the GUI so that it views the basic solution and cost at all times. But other than that, the program is nearly complete, and is already completely functional.
